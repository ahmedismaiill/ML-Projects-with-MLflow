üè¶ Loan Approval Prediction Dataset

üìÑ Overview
This repository provides a synthetic dataset designed for classification tasks related to loan approval prediction. Inspired by the [original Kaggle dataset on Loan Approval Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/loan-approval-classification-data), this version is enhanced with additional financial risk variables and scaled up using SMOTENC to improve class balance and size for machine learning experimentation.
