# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction Dataset

## 📄 Overview

This repository provides a **synthetic dataset** designed for **loan approval prediction** tasks using machine learning.
Inspired by the [original Kaggle Loan Approval Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/loan-approval-classification-data), this version has been **enhanced with additional financial risk variables** and **balanced using SMOTENC**, allowing for more robust experimentation and evaluation of classification models.

## 📁 Dataset Metadata

* **Records:** 45,000 samples
* **Features:** 13 columns *(after removing data-leakage variable)*
* **Target Variable:** `loan_status` (binary classification: `1 = approved`, `0 = rejected`)

| Column Name                  | Description                                                    | Type        |

| `person_income`              | Annual income in USD                                           | Float       |
| `person_emp_exp`             | Years of employment experience                                 | Integer     |
| `person_home_ownership`      | Home ownership status (e.g., rent, own, mortgage)              | Categorical |
| `loan_amnt`                  | Loan amount requested                                          | Float       |
| `loan_intent`                | Purpose of the loan (e.g., personal, education, medical, etc.) | Categorical |
| `loan_int_rate`              | Interest rate on the loan                                      | Float       |
| `loan_percent_income`        | Loan amount as a percentage of the person’s income             | Float       |
| `cb_person_cred_hist_length` | Length of credit history in years                              | Float       |
| `credit_score`               | Credit score of the person                                     | Integer     |
| `loan_status`                | Loan approval status (`1 = approved`, `0 = rejected`)          | Integer     |

> ⚠️ **Note:**
> The column `previous_loan_defaults_on_file` was **removed** due to **data leakage**, as it directly correlated with the loan approval decision, leading to artificially inflated performance.

## 🧠 Model Performance — XGBoost + SMOTE

| Metric                    | Value |
| ------------------------- | ----- |
| **Accuracy**              | 0.92  |
| **Precision (Class 0)**   | 0.92  |
| **Recall (Class 0)**      | 0.98  |
| **F1-score (Class 0)**    | 0.95  |
| **Precision (Class 1)**   | 0.88  |
| **Recall (Class 1)**      | 0.67  |
| **F1-score (Class 1)**    | 0.76  |
| **Macro Avg F1-score**    | 0.85  |
| **Weighted Avg F1-score** | 0.91  |

✅ **Final Accuracy:** **92%** using **XGBoost** on **SMOTE-balanced data**
📉 **Leakage Check:** Dataset verified after removing `previous_loan_defaults_on_file` to ensure fair model evaluation.
