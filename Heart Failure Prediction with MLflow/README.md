ðŸ’“ Heart Failure Prediction with MLflow
This project uses machine learning to predict the risk of heart failure based on clinical and lifestyle features. It leverages MLflow for efficient model tracking, experiment management, and reproducibility.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview
Rows: 70,000 patient records
Columns: 19 features including symptoms, risk factors, and the target label Heart_Risk
Target Variable: Heart_Risk (indicates the presence of heart failure risk)
